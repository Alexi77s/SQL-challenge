# SQL-challenge
This challenge made me understand how to create databases, tables and import csvs in PgAdmin4. SQL was used to create other tables by joining previous tables that were imported. Also, filter out information that I am not focused on and to center on a specific information. 
Included are the (ERD) Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables from utilizing QuickDBD and .sql file with the schema and quieries.
